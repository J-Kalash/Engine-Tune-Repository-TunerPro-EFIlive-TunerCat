Interesting! Since we don't actually need SDLDSUA to be full range, can't we change that to ashr 3h and a compare (to cap it)? Then you only need to cut the data in half.

Assuming that your boost target is around the MAP limit or that you were just going to replicate the last value above 2560 mbar?

Yes.

The offset is already capped at 16 members in the code with a compare.

The code is located at 0x6EDF4 in both versions of M box. Change BC 4F to BC 3F if you want to go that route.","","",""
