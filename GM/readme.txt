The following section defines various architectures of GM ECMs. These represent the top level difference between tuning stuctures.

Roughly speaking:
E38's are normally found in all half ton trucks with the GEN 4 V8 from 2007.5-2013, so that silverado/sierra/yukon/tahoe etc. The 2500/3500 gas trucks only used that computer until 2010-2011 before they switched newer E78 controller.

Corvettes started after 07-08, double check that. CTS-V's were the same thing, after like 08-09 years because the first few years were E67 controllers. New body style camaro's were E38 until the DI engines in 2016-ish.

E40's were 05-06 GTO's, I think 2005 corvettes. The first 2 years of the trailblazer SS were E40's with the 07-08 trucks being E67's.

P01's were GEN 3 trucks from 99-02, camaro/firebird from 98-02, corvette from 97-03??.

P59's started in 03-07 from GEN 3 trucks, first gen CTS-V's used that computer, 2004 GTO's, the express vans and savana vans used that computer from 03-07 as well.
